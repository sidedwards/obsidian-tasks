# Getting a test vault to a Mobile Device

- Sometimes we ask users to supply a vault for us to use for testing
- If the bug only occurs on mobile, how do you open the vault on the mobile device?

## Via Obsidian Sync

If you happen to have an [Obsidian Sync](obsidian sync help) licence with fewer than 5 vaults set up, you can use Sync to get the vault to the mobile device:

### On the desktop

- Open the vault on Desktop
- Set up Sync
  - For simplicity, let Obsidian manage the end-to-end encryption
- Turn on syncing of all settings
- Let it sync

### On Mobile

- Set up sync
- Turn on syncing of all settings
- Let it sync
- Restart Obsidian

### Afterwards

- Delete the sync vault, to free up your allocation.
